# HANG-MAN
Hang-man is a word-guessing game with a timer to track your progress and how long it will take for you to win or lose. 
It is very straightforward and easy to play. It allows you to visually see how far you have come whether its a win and the letters are displayed, or, the hang-man is visually developed as you guess the wrong letters. 

## HOW TO PLAY
1. The computer will choose a secret word.
2. You have to guess one letter at a time.
3. You can only guess letters (no numbers or special characters).
4. You have a limited number of incorrect guesses before you lose the game.
5. Try to guess the word before you run out of guesses!
6. Good luck and have fun!
